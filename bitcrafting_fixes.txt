TOOLS
 - enchantment effect tinted by bit tool model
 - bit pickaxe got to very low durability (6/276) and then stopped functioning as a pickaxe. After leaving and rejoining, it worked again
 - anomaly pickaxe can turn gold into diamonds and emeralds, needs a nerf somehow
 - efficiency for all blocks is now 1

RECIPES/ORES
 - sometimes null bits drop from ores (Has not been seen recently)
 - crucible xp sometimes doesn't drop?
 - bit crucible no longer combines partial stacks due to removing xp from nbt
 - match ore block textures to bit colors

MISC
 ? some bits seem identical but won't stack
 - certain inventory shortcuts don't work in the BitGUIContainer (ctrl+click, maybe others?) (seems like an inventoryTweaks thing)
 - fix when crafting recipes get added to recipe book
 - bit forge does weird things when the input is updated

FUTURE PLANS
 - shields
 - bows/crossbows/arrows
 - more inter-mod recipes
 - advancements
