TOOLS
 - enchantment effect tinted by bit tool model
 - bit pickaxe got to very low durability (6/276) and then stopped functioning as a pickaxe. After leaving and rejoining, it worked again
 - anomaly pickaxe can turn gold into diamonds and emeralds, needs a nerf somehow
 - restrict tool repairing to equal harvest level or greater
 - can't mine stone button

RECIPES/ORES
 - sometimes empty bits drop from ores (Has not been seen recently)
 - crucible xp might not drop for secondary crucible results

MISC
 ? some bits seem identical but won't stack
 - certain inventory shortcuts don't work in the BitGUIContainer (ctrl+click, maybe others?) (seems like an inventoryTweaks thing)
 - bit crucible no longer combines partial stacks due to removing xp from nbt
